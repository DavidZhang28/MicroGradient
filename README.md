MicroGradient is an algorithm that performs gradient descent on data, using ReLU for binary classification.
It is recreating PyTorch's forward and backward propagation algorithms (currently with either ReLU or Tanh) to implement gradient descent
Demo.jpynb is an example use case for binary classification of datasets.
